# Bayesian Causal Inference Model

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Bayesian causal inference model using a hierarchical framework. The code simulates data, constructs a Bayesian model with PyMC, runs MCMC sampling, and generates interactive plots with Plotly to visualize posterior distributions, trace plots, and posterior predictive checks.
