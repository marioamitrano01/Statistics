# The Macroeconomic Determinants of Brent Crude Oil Price Dynamics: A VAR and Multi-Regression Econometric Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between Brent crude oil prices and key macroeconomic variables (dollar index, inflation, GDP, and interest rates) using econometric modeling techniques.

## Methodologies
- Vector Autoregression (VAR) modeling
- Multiple regression with lagged variables
- Lead-lag relationship analysis
- Rolling correlation analysis
- Impulse response functions
- Forecast error variance decomposition

## Key Variables
- Brent crude oil prices (USD per barrel)
- US Dollar Index
- Consumer Price Index (inflation)
- Real GDP
- Federal Funds Rate (interest rate)

## Outputs
The script generates multiple visualizations:
- Time series plots of all variables
- Correlation heatmap
- Lead-lag analysis
- Regression coefficients
- VAR impulse responses
- Variable contributions to oil price
