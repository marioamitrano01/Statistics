# CryptoForest: Machine Learning Framework for Cryptocurrency Price Analysis

A machine learning framework for retrospective analysis and model evaluation on cryptocurrency price data.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive backtesting system for cryptocurrency price modeling using machine learning techniques. It evaluates how different Random Forest models perform on historical BTC/USDT data through feature engineering, model training, and comparative analysis.


### Model Selection Rationale

Random Forest models were chosen for their:
- Robustness to overfitting in noisy financial data
- Ability to capture non-linear relationships
- Built-in feature importance analysis
- Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation
